### About this project 

This is my attempt to build a git with its basic functionalities. Here are the rules I 
imposed to myself for this project

- The project should be built based on the information provided by the git official documentation 
    - The official git project can be checked
- It needs be unit tested
- It needs to be simple to run the project
- It need to be simple to run the unit tests

### Conventions

- Every function named with the prefix sf_ should have its return variable freed;

### Roadmap 

- [x] Setup build system for building project and run unit tests
- [x] Create first iteration of "git hash-object" --> parse arguments and return hash
- [ ] Create init first iteration --> build obj database 
- [ ] store hashed object inside object database
